# SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS CODES
-synchronous codes also called -> blocking code. bcz for slow operations code might wait for the task to to be completed first.
-solution to this problem is asynchronous code -> non blocking code.
-we assign the heavy work(such as loading some files to be done in background).
-when the work is done the callack function which was used registered before is called to handle the result.
-During the time this heavy task was being done the rest of the code runs so there is no blocking of the rest of the code in this case.

whats the problem with blocking the code ?
